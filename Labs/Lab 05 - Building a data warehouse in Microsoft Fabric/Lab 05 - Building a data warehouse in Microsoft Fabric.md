# **Lab 05-Building a Sales and Geography Data Warehouse for Contoso in Microsoft Fabric**
**Introduction**

Contoso, a multinational retail company, is looking to modernize its
data infrastructure to improve sales and geographical analysis.
Currently, their sales and customer data is scattered across multiple
systems, making it difficult for their business analysts and citizen
developers to derive insights. The company plans to consolidate this
data into a unified platform using Microsoft Fabric to enable
cross-querying, sales analysis, and geographical reporting.

In this lab, youâ€™ll assume the role of a data engineer at Contoso tasked
with designing and implementing a data warehouse solution using
Microsoft Fabric. You will start by setting up a Fabric workspace,
creating a data warehouse, loading data from Azure Blob Storage, and
performing analytical tasks to deliver insights to Contoso's
decision-makers.

While many concepts in Microsoft Fabric may be familiar to data and
analytics professionals, it can be challenging to apply those concepts
in a new environment. This lab has been designed to walk step-by-step
through an end-to-end scenario from data acquisition to data consumption
to build a basic understanding of the Microsoft Fabric user experience,
the various experiences and their integration points, and the Microsoft
Fabric professional and citizen developer experiences.

**Objectives**

  - Set up a Fabric workspace with trial enabled.

  - Establish a new Warehouse named WideWorldImporters in Microsoft
    Fabric.

  - Load data into the Warehouse\_FabricXX workspace using a Data
    Factory pipeline.

  - Generate dimension\_city and fact\_sale tables within the data
    warehouse.

  - Populate dimension\_city and fact\_sale tables with data from Azure
    Blob Storage.

  - Create clones of dimension\_city and fact\_sale tables in the
    Warehouse.

  - Clone dimension\_city and fact\_sale tables into the dbo1 schema.

  - Develop a stored procedure to transform data and create
    aggregate\_sale\_by\_date\_city table.

  - Generate a query using the visual query builder to merge and
    aggregate data.

  - Use a notebook to query and analyze data from the
    dimension\_customer table.

  - Include WideWorldImporters and ShortcutExercise warehouses for
    cross-querying.

  - Execute a T-SQL query across WideWorldImporters and ShortcutExercise
    warehouses.

  - Enable Azure Maps visual integration in the Admin portal.

  - Generate column chart, map, and table visuals for Sales Analysis
    report.

  - Create a report using data from the WideWorldImporters dataset in
    the OneLake data hub.

  - Remove the workspace and its associated
items.

    record which has the **SaleKey **value of **22632918.**
    Select **Run** to execute the query.
    
    SQLCopy
      ```
      /*Update the TotalIncludingTax value of the record with SaleKey value of 22632918*/
      UPDATE [dbo].[fact_sale]
      SET TotalIncludingTax = 200000000
      WHERE SaleKey = 22632918;
      ```
    
     ![](./media/image87.png)

8.  In the query editor, paste the following code.
    The CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP T-SQL function returns the current UTC
    timestamp as a **datetime**. Select **Run** to execute the query.
    
      SQLCopy
      ```
      SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
      ```

9.  Copy the timestamp value returned to your clipboard.
      ![](./media/image89.png)

10. Paste the following code in the query editor and replace the
    timestamp value with the current timestamp value obtained from the
    prior step. The timestamp syntax format
    is **YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.FFF]**

11. Remove the trailing zeroes, for
    example: **2024-04-24T20:59:06.097**.

12. The following example returns the list of top ten customers
    by **TotalIncludingTax**, including the new value
    for **SaleKey** 22632918. Replace the existing code and paste the
    following code and select **Run** to execute the query.
    
    SQLCopy
    ```
   /*View of Top10 Customers as of today after record updates*/
    SELECT *
    FROM [WideWorldImporters].[dbo].[Top10CustomersView]
    OPTION (FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-04-24T20:59:06.097');
    ```

   ![](./media/image90.png)

14. Paste the following code in the query editor and replace the
    timestamp value to a time prior to executing the update script to
    update the **TotalIncludingTax** value. This would return the list
    of top ten customers *before* the **TotalIncludingTax** was updated
    for **SaleKey** 22632918. Select **Run** to execute the query.
    
    SQLCopy
    ```
    /\*View of Top10 Customers as of today before record updates\*/
    
    SELECT \*
    
    FROM \[WideWorldImporters\].\[dbo\].\[Top10CustomersView\]
    
    OPTION (FOR TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-04-24T20:49:06.097');

# Exercise 8: Analyze data with a notebook

## Task 1: Create a lakehouse shortcut and analyze data with an notebook

In this task, learn about how you can save your data once and then use
it with many other services. Shortcuts can also be created to data
stored in Azure Data Lake Storage and S3 to enable you to directly
access delta tables from external systems.

First, we create a new lakehouse. To create a new lakehouse in your
Microsoft Fabric workspace:

1.  On the **WideWorldImportes** page, click on **Warehouse_FabricXX**
    Workspace on the left-sided navigation
    menu.

      ![](./media/image111.png)

2.  On the **Synapse Data Engineering Warehouse\_FabricXX** home page, under the **Warehouse\_FabricXX** pane, click **+New item**, and then select **Lakehouse **under **Stored data**

     ![](./media/image112.png)

3.  In the **Name** field, enter **!!ShortcutExercise!!** and click on
    the **Create** button.

     ![](./media/image113.png)

4.  The new lakehouse loads and the **Explorer** view opens up, with
    the **Get data in your lakehouse** menu. Under **Load data in your
    lakehouse**, select the **New shortcut** button.

     ![](./media/image114.png)

5.  In the **New shortcut** window, select **Microsoft OneLake**.

     ![](./media/image115.png)

6.  In the **Select a data source type** window, carefully navigate and
    click on the **Warehouse** named **WideWorldImporters** that youâ€™ve
    created previously, then click on the **Next** button**.**

     ![](./media/image116.png)

7.  In the **OneLake** object browser, expand **Tables**, then expand
    the **dbo** schema, and select the radio button
    beside **dimension\_customer**. Select the **Next** button.

     ![](./media/image117.png)

8.  In the **New shortcut** window, click on the **Create** button and
    click on the **Close** button

     ![](./media/image118.png)
   
      ![](./media/image119.png)

9.  Wait for a while and then click on the **Refresh** icon.

10. Then, select the **dimension_customer** in the **Table** list to
    preview the data. Notice that the lakehouse is showing the data from
    the **dimension_customer** table from the Warehouse.

     ![](./media/image120.png)

11. Next, create a new notebook to query
    the **dimension_customer** table. In the **Home** ribbon, select
    the drop down for **Open notebook** and choose **New notebook**.

      ![](./media/image121.png)

12. Select, then drag the **dimension_customer** from
    the **Tables** list into the open notebook cell. You can see a
    **PySpark** query has been written for you to query all the data
    from **ShortcutExercise.dimension_customer**. This notebook
    experience is similar to Visual Studio Code Jupyter notebook
    experience. You can also open the notebook in VS Code.

     ![](./media/image122.png)

13. In the **Home** ribbon, select the **Run all** button. Once the
    query is completed, you will see you can easily use PySpark to query
    the Warehouse tables\!

    the **+ Warehouses** button.

      ![](./media/image126.png)

4.  In Add warehouses window, select **ShortcutExercise** and click on
    the **Confirm** button. Both warehouse experiences are added to the
    query.

    ![](./media/image127.png)

5.  Your selected warehouses now show the same **Explorer** pane.
    
    ![](./media/image128.png)

## Task 2: Execute a cross-warehouse query

In this example, you can see how easily you can run T-SQL queries across
the WideWorldImporters warehouse and ShortcutExercise SQL Endpoint. You
can write cross-database queries using three-part naming to reference
the database.schema.table, as in SQL Server.

1.  From the **Home** tab of the ribbon, select **New SQL query**.

    ![](./media/image129.png)

2.  In the query editor, copy and paste the following T-SQL code. Select
    the **Run** button to execute the query. After the query is
    completed, you will see the results.
      ```
      SELECT Sales.StockItemKey, 
      Sales.Description, 
      SUM(CAST(Sales.Quantity AS int)) AS SoldQuantity, 
      c.Customer
      FROM [dbo].[fact_sale] AS Sales,
      [ShortcutExercise].[dbo].[dimension_customer] AS c
      WHERE Sales.CustomerKey = c.CustomerKey
      GROUP BY Sales.StockItemKey, Sales.Description, c.Customer;
      
      ```
      
      ![](./media/image130.png)

3.  Rename the query for reference. Right-click on **SQL query** in the
    **Explorer** and select **Rename**.

**Summary**

This comprehensive lab walks through a series of tasks aimed at
establishing a functional data environment in Microsoft Fabric. It
starts with the creation of a workspace, essential for data operations,
and ensures the trial is enabled. Subsequently, a Warehouse named
WideWorldImporters is established within the Fabric environment to serve
as the central repository for data storage and processing. Data
ingestion into the Warehouse\_FabricXX workspace is then detailed
through the implementation of a Data Factory pipeline. This process
involves fetching data from external sources and integrating it
seamlessly into the workspace. Critical tables, dimension\_city, and
fact\_sale, are created within the data warehouse to serve as
foundational structures for data analysis. The data loading process
continues with the use of T-SQL, where data from Azure Blob Storage is
transferred into the specified tables. The subsequent tasks delve into
the realm of data management and manipulation. Cloning tables is
demonstrated, offering a valuable technique for data replication and
testing purposes. Additionally, the cloning process is extended to a
different schema (dbo1) within the same warehouse, showcasing a
structured approach to data organization. The lab progresses to data
transformation, introducing the creation of a stored procedure to
efficiently aggregate sales data. It then transitions to visual query
building, providing an intuitive interface for complex data queries.
This is followed by an exploration of notebooks, demonstrating their
utility in querying and analyzing data from the dimension\_customer
table. Multi-warehouse querying capabilities are then unveiled, allowing
for seamless data retrieval across various warehouses within the
workspace. The lab culminates in enabling Azure Maps visuals
integration, enhancing geographical data representation in Power BI.
Subsequently, a range of Power BI reports, including column charts,
maps, and tables, are created to facilitate in-depth sales data
analysis. The final task focuses on generating a report from the OneLake
data hub, further emphasizing the versatility of data sources in Fabric.
Finally, the lab provides insights into resource management, emphasizing
the importance of cleanup procedures to maintain an efficient workspace.
Collectively, these tasks present a comprehensive understanding of
setting up, managing, and analyzing data within Microsoft Fabric.
